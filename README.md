## UX/DX Approach Adopted

The UX focuses on providing a native and seamless Android experience, with a user-friendly interface for submitting ratings. DX is prioritized with a modular and scalable MVVM codebase using Android Studio and Firebase for backend services

## Git Approach

### Branching Strategy
The `main` branch holds stable releases, while an `assignment_2_dev` feature branch was created for new features and bug fixes, this will be merged when a new release is ready for deployment.

## Personal Statement

RateMyInstitute was developed to address the need for a reliable Android application for students to access valuable insights into educational institutions. Challenges in integrating Firebase for authentication and Google Cloud for backend services were overcome, providing valuable learning experiences in Android development.
